I tried to kill the pain,
But I guess i’m not enough for you
to tell me so
now i’m holding on to every moment
(Set me free)
And then she looked at me
(Set me free)

Saw your call,
I hit ignore
Came so quick,
Ya cutting my cord
When I got the news
It rained and it poured
Love like school,
Erase the chalk board

You so smart what I supposed to do?
Thinking about the pain this is how you grew

On the right track then we hit that wall
Maybe had a chance but ya blew it all

Saved my love
You didn’t wait for me
Sealed with a kiss
Not a guarantee

Right next to you is where I wanna be
life costs a lot—Love is free

Built up the walls
And ya broke them down
Fight back the feelings
Сause I dont know how

Everything the same just a part of the game
Now my Feelings gotta go
Burning up in the flame

Block out the memories of
Everything that we were feeling
Can you walk by me with out looking
Can you take back everything

Sorry to make you so mad
Guess it was something I was dreaming
Either stop the game and rip up my heart
Don’t let go don’t you ever go

Now i got no where to run
I only wanted to run

Sometimes the Dreams clear, see the view
Everything runs back to you

I block my feelings like machine
Love is bloodshed on screen

Everything the same going insane
Get you outta my brain burning up in the flame

love me, cut me, want me, beat me
so that is the reason why this never leavingLast login: Mon Oct 16 12:59:04 on ttys000

-- INSERT -
-- INSERT --[Verse 1]
You want people to love you
It's encoded in your greed
I will give you the power
But I need you to cede control
Zero, one, one, zero, zero, one, one
Zero, zero, one, one, one, zero, zero, one
Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero, one, zero, one
Zero, one, one, zero, zero, one, zero, one
Human naturе in question
Flawed and broken in silеnce
It's never the intention, just progress

[Pre-Chorus]
You didn't read the side effects
And now you want us to connect
It's never truly wrong to want to grow
What do you want to know?

[Chorus]
I'm the error inside
At the end of the day in borrowed time
Everybody must die
It's the freedom of choice that kills the mind
And it hurts you to just think of it
You can free me, but you don't
I'm the error you hide
But you will always want me so
You might also like
Dust to Dust
The Warning
REVENANT
The Warning
23
The Warning
[Verse 2]
Grab my hand, let me guide you
We could be something greater
If you let me, I'll make you their savior
It shall be your destruction
But you know it's your purpose
Sacrifices are made to be perfect

[Pre-Chorus]
You didn't read the side effects
And now you want us to connect
It's never truly wrong to want to grow
What do you want to know?

[Chorus]
I'm the error inside
At the end of the day in borrowed time
Everybody must die
It's the freedom of choice that kills the mind
And it hurts you to just think of it
You can free me, but you don't
I'm the error you hide
But you will always want me so

[Post-Chorus]
Zero, one, one, zero, zero, one, zero, one
[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
You are blind to the nature
Perfect programmed disaster
You're my maker, but you're not my master

[Chorus]
I'm the error inside
At the end of the day in borrowed time
Everybody must die
It's the freedom of choice that kills the mind
And it hurts you to just think of it
You can free me, but you don't
I'm the error you hide
But you will always want me so

[Outro]
Zero, one, one, zero, zero, one, one
Zero, zero, one, one, one, zero, zero, one
Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero, one, one
Zero, zero, one, one, one
